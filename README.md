# Matching Memory

## Codecademy Project

When introducing Redux to a React application, you transfer the responsibility of state management over to Redux. This is great because Redux is really good at state management, but this also hinders Reactâ€™s optimized UI rendering. That is why <code>react-redux</code> was created to bind the UI rendering of React to the state management of Redux.

This project explores where <code>react-redux</code> fits into an application by finishing off the implementation of a one-player matching game.

The application consists of 5 React components:

1. <code>App</code>: The root component, <code>App</code> renders the <code>Score</code> and <code>Board</code> components.
2. <code>Score</code>: Child of the <code>App</code> component, <code>Score</code> will display the number of matched cards.
3. <code>Board</code>: Child of the <code>App</code> component, <code>Board</code> will create the card grid for gameplay.
4. <code>CardRow</code>: Child of the <code>Board</code> component, <code>CardRow</code> renders a row of <code>Card</code> components.
5. <code>Card</code>: Child of the <code>CardRow</code> component, <code>Card</code> displays the card content when flipped over.

One goal of this project will be to show that a nested component like <code>Card</code> can access data and dispatch actions as easily as a higher-level component like <code>App</code> or <code>Score</code>.

Most of the Redux store logic is implemented in **boardSlice.js**. This includes initializing the <code>state</code>, the reducers, and the action creators.

The application <code>state</code> is an array of 12 objects with each object representing a card:

```
// card object
{
  id: uniqueID, 
  contents: wordString, 
  visible: visibleBoolean, 
  matched: matchedBoolean
}
```

There are 3 actions needed to run the game:

- <code>setGame</code>: randomize the card array and set visible and matched of all cards to false
- <code>flipCard</code>: set visible of the specified card id to true
- <code>resetCards</code>: set visible to false on unmatched cards

To complete this project you will add a `<Provider />` component, implement selectors, retrieve data from the <code>store</code> with <code>useSelector()</code>, and dispatch actions with the help of <code>useDispatch()</code>. With all of this ahead of you, explore the starting code of the application and then move on to the first task to begin implementing the matching game.
